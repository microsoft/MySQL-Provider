# This script will create a bundle file given an existing kit.
#
# Parameters:
#	$1: Platform type
#	$2: Directory to package file
#	$3: Package name for MySQL package (without extension)
#
# We expect this script to run from the BUILD directory (i.e. mysql/build).
# Directory paths are hard-coded for this location.

# Notes for file bundle_skel.sh (included here since we dont want to ship
# these comments in shell bundle):
#
# This script is a skeleton bundle file for the MySQL project, which only
# ships in universal form (RPM & DEB installers for the Linux platforms).
#
# Use this script by concatenating it with some binary package.
#
# The bundle is created by cat'ing the script in front of the binary, so for
# the gzip'ed tar example, a command like the following will build the bundle:
#
#     tar -czvf - <target-dir> | cat sfx.skel - > my.bundle
#
# The bundle can then be copied to a system, made executable (chmod +x) and
# then run.  When run without any options it will make any pre-extraction
# calls, extract the binary, and then make any post-extraction calls.
#
# This script has some usefull helper options to split out the script and/or
# binary in place, and to turn on shell debugging.
#
# This script is paired with create_bundle.sh, which will edit constants in
# this script for proper execution at runtime.  The "magic", here, is that
# create_bundle.sh encodes the length of this script in the script itself.
# Then the script can use that with 'tail' in order to strip the script from
# the binary package.
#
# Developer note: A prior incarnation of this script used 'sed' to strip the
# script from the binary package.  That didn't work on AIX 5, where 'sed' did
# strip the binary package - AND null bytes, creating a corrupted stream.
#
# MySQL-specific implementaiton: Unlike CM & OM projects, this bundle does
# not install OMI.  Why a bundle, then?  Primarily so a single package can
# install either a .DEB file or a .RPM file, whichever is appropraite.  This
# significantly simplies the complexity of installation by the Management
# Pack (MP) in the Operations Manager product.
